    "> Based on the accuracy on both the training and testing datasets, logistic regression achieved higher accuracy compared to the decision tree. Logistic regression achieved an accuracy of 0.9561 on the testing dataset, while the decision tree achieved an accuracy of 0.9123. Considering the nature of a clinical setting where accurate predictions are crucial, logistic regression's higher accuracy suggests that it may be more appropriate for this particular scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When dealing with classification of this nature, it is very important to correctly identify all positive cases as positives. Therefore, a model with a high true positive (TP) rate and a low false negative (FN) rate is desired, even if that comes at the cost of a greater number of false positives. This is not too much of an issue, as the patient will simply undergo further tests to confirm or deny the positive (malignant) diagnosis. A measure of TP and FN is called sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Looking at the confusion matrices, logistic regression has fewer false positives (FP=0) compared to the decision tree (FP=5), indicating that logistic regression may be better at minimising false positive predictions, which can be particularly important in a clinical setting where minimising false positives is often desired. This would decrease the number of unnecessary treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The precision-recall curve also shows a higher precision for logistic regression. This indicates that logistic regression may have a better ability to correctly identify positive cases (higher precision) compared to the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Considering all these factors, it is recommended to use logistic regression in this clinical setting due to its higher accuracy, lower false positive rate, higher precision, and higher sensitivity. However, specific clinical requirements and computational power should be considered when making a final selection."

    "> The PCA plot of the dataset reveals important features about the data. Firstly, there is a clear separation between the benign and malignant samples, with many benign samples clustering on the negative side of the 1st principal component, while numerous malignant instances are concentrated on the positive end. A decision boundary can be placed between the two classes. The 1st principle component holds most of the variance of the data, hence, is more important to the categorisation of the data,\n",
    "\n",
    "> Perpendicular to this decision boundary, there is a collection of overlapping features, `perimeter_mean`, `area_mean`, and `radius_mean`. These features are highly correlated due to the circular nature of the cell's nucleus. The PCA plot confirms this correlation, as they exhibit similar loadings. The `texture_mean` feature also aligns with the same direction, but with a lower loading, indicating its relatively lower importance. The direction of these four features suggests a fairly strong correlation between them and the classification of instances, as they are perpendicular to the decision boundary. Also, a significant proportion of their direction lies within the 1st principal component, which accounts for a larger portion of the variance compared to the y-direction (2nd principal axis).\n",

    "> In the direction of the decision boundary, we observe features such as `fractal_dimension_mean`, `smoothness_mean`, and `symmetry_mean`. These features have larger components in the y-direction, indicating their lesser importance compared to the previously discussed features. Moreover, since they align with the decision boundary direction, they do not provide significant valuable information for the classification.\n",

The general order of features remains consistent. This indicates that PCA is effective in providing valuable information about features in a dataset."

For this data, `Murder`, `Assault` and `Rape` were measured per 100,000. Whereas the `UrbanPop` was a percentage. It is therefore necessary to scale the data to allow for better data implementation. Scaling eliminates the potential dominance of variables with larger magnitudes, which in this case is `Murder`, `Assault` and `Rape`.\n",

This can be attributed to the scaling process, which equalises the importance of each variable in the clustering analysis.
